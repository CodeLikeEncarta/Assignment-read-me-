Question: When do we use fixed sizes and percentages?
Answer:
We use fix sizes when we want to keep the size of our elements. Meaning no matter what content is placed inside the element the height and width doesnâ€™t re size with respect to the content 
We use percentages when we want our contents to re size and fit into the size of our element it is placed in. Percentages resolve against the size of the containing block.
